Adds a side panel that displays useful information about your discord party members who are also using this plugin, such
as their Inventory, worn Equipment, Active Prayers, and skill levels.

# Using the plugin

This plugin uses the [RuneLite Discord Plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Discord) to grab your Discord
Avatar. While not required for this plugin to work,
I recommend enabling the [RuneLite Party Plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Party) for its unique
features, such as tile pinging. I would recommend disabling the `Stats` option for
the RuneLite Party Plugin to remove the in-game overlays if you just want to use this party plugin.

To learn more about joining a party please read
the [RuneLite Wiki Page](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Party#how-to-create-a-party) about this.
