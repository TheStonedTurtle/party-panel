# Party Panel
Adds a side panel that displays useful information about your discord party members who are also using this plugin.

# Using the plugin
This plugin requires the ![RuneLite Discord Plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Discord) to be enabled and is compatible with the ![RuneLite Party Plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Party) but does not require it. I would recommend keeping the Party plugin enabled and disabling the `Stats` option to remove the in-game overlays.

To learn more about joining a party please read the ![RuneLite Wiki Page](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Party#how-to-create-a-party) about this.
